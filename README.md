# Customer Churn Prediction - Machine Learning Project
In this challenge, I developed a Machine Learning model aimed at predicting potential customer churn for the company we collaborated with. Using a CSV dataset containing customer data, I followed the CRISP-DM (Cross-Industry Standard Process for Data Mining) methodology to guide the entire analysis and modeling process. This structured approach ensured a thorough and well-organized workflow, from understanding the business problem to deploying the model.

## Methodology - CRISP-DM Framework
The CRISP-DM process was crucial in driving each phase of the project, ensuring that every step was aligned with the business goals and provided actionable insights.

### Business Understanding: The primary goal was to identify which customers were most likely to churn, allowing the company to take proactive measures to retain them. By reducing churn, the company could improve customer loyalty and overall profitability.

### Data Understanding: The raw data, provided in a CSV format, contained customer demographics, purchase history, and engagement metrics. An initial exploration was performed to detect any anomalies, missing values, and to understand the key features that could influence churn behavior.

### Data Preparation: Data cleaning and preprocessing steps were essential to ensure the dataset was in the right format for modeling. This included handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, feature scaling, and balancing the dataset to address class imbalance.

### Modeling: Various machine learning algorithms were tested, including Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, and Random Forest. The focus was on identifying patterns that could differentiate churned customers from loyal ones. Hyperparameter tuning was also applied to optimize model performance.

### Evaluation: The models were evaluated using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score metrics. Special attention was given to recall and precision to avoid false positives and false negatives, ensuring the company could act on reliable predictions.

### Deployment: The final model was deployed, with a focus on easy integration into the company's CRM system. The deployment allowed the company to use real-time predictions to identify high-risk customers and initiate retention strategies.

## Results
The final model showed high accuracy and reliability in predicting customer churn. By implementing this model, the company can take preemptive actions to reduce churn, improving customer retention rates and increasing long-term value.

## Technologies Used
Python: For data manipulation, modeling, and evaluation.
Pandas & NumPy: For data preprocessing and handling.
Scikit-learn: For implementing the machine learning models.
Matplotlib & Seaborn: For data visualization.
CRISP-DM: As the methodology guiding the analysis.
In this challenge, I created a Machine Learning model to predict the customers that would possibly be "churned" to the company we were working with. From a database. .csv, I used the CRISP DM methodology as the basis for my analysis
